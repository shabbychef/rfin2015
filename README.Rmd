```{r dir_listing, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
# I am surprised there is not already a 
# directory -> Markdown link listing function
# (maybe there is ;)
dlist <- dir()
finfo <- file.info(dlist)
isd <- finfo$isdir
dinfo <- finfo[isd,]
links <- sapply(rownames(dinfo),function(d) {
	sprintf('  * [%s](%s)',d,d) })
cat(paste0(links,collapse='\n'))
```
